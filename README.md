6/19/2019: We now have basic unit conversion working, and the executable v1.0 is now available.

6/16/2019: The GUI will now accept negative numbers, and you have metric or English options for units. I also added a gravity check box, as an experiment.

6/13/2019: I tried to clean up all the junk. I think everything new is in the master, now. GUI should now save the solved numbers, and has slots for force and mass.

6/6/2019: GUI now integrated with Equations.java and Formulas.java. Simplified to one button. New product backlog and burn down chart added to documents. PowerPoint for presentation 2 also added to documents. All in June 6 branch.

5/30/2019: Product Backlog updated.

5/29/2019: We now have drop-down menus that save previous entries. Each time you enter a variable value, and hit ENTER, it is saved, and added to a list. This way you can reuse previous entries, if you are solving a problem that might use the same variable multiple times.

5/26/2019: We now a FILE and HELP menu in the GUI, that will save and open files, and gives some info on who we are and who we've borrowed code from.
