# sophomore-project
Physics Calculator - 
Ok, big update to everything. Everything works, has been renamed, and cleaned up. I added a title, and built the help window. Just waiting for the guts to be added.

To run it, start a new project in Netbeans (probably should name it javafxapplication10, since that's what this one is called).
- JavaFX - JavaFXML Application.

Delete whatever's in the SRC folder, and dump all these java files into it
(or copy and paste the file contents - whatever works).

In the SRC folder, create an "images" folder, and put the .jpgs in there.

I put a couple sceenshots in - hopefully they will help.
